# Hello, Pages! Theme

GitHub Pages Sample using the new Jekyll plugins for easy publishing, namely 
Jekyll Optional Front Matter, 
Jekyll README Index, 
Jekyll Default Layout, and 
Jekyll Titles from Headings.


### Relative Links

Thanks to the  Jekyll Relative Links plugin, you can link to markdown source files
and GitHub Pages automatically changes the the link to hypertext (.html) e.g.

     [Page Two](two.md)  becomes <a href="two.html">Page Two</a>

Try it. Follow along to [Page Two](two.md).
